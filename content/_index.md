Hi, my name is Carlo Delle Donne (he/him).

I was born in Potenza, Italy, in 1994. I obtained my MSc in Embedded Systems at
TU Delft, specializing on low-power, battery-free sensor nodes. I then completed
a PhD in Quantum Communication Systems at TU Delft, where I worked with other
researchers to design and implement a software stack for quantum internet nodes,
and bridge the gap between abstract quantum networking applications and
complicated quantum physical hardware.

Besides an embedded systems engineer and an open-source software enthusiast, I
enjoy travelling, visiting museums, binging movies (the weirder, the better),
blasting music in my apartment, doing sports, and cooking with other people.
