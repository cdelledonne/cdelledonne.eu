Hi, my name is Carlo Delle Donne (he/him).

I was born in Potenza, Italy, in 1994.  I obtained my Electronics and
Telecommunications Engineering BSc at the University of Bologna, and my Embedded
Systems MSc at TU Delft.  I then joined [QuTech](https://qutech.nl/) (Delft, the
Netherlands) as a PhD student in December 2018.  I am working with other
researchers to design and implement a software stack for quantum internet nodes,
and bridge the gap between abstract quantum networking applications and
complicated quantum physical hardware.

Besides being a quantum internet researcher, an embedded systems engineer and an
open-source software enthusiast, I enjoy travelling, visiting museums, binging
movies (the weirder, the better), blasting music in my apartment, doing sports,
and cooking with other people.
