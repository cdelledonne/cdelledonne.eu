Carlo Delle Donne (Potenza, Italy, 1994) studied Electronics and
Telecommunications Engineering (BSc) at the University of Bologna, and Embedded
Systems (MSc) at TU Delft.  He then joined QuTech (Delft, the Netherlands) as a
PhD student in December 2018.  He is working with other researchers to design
and implement a software stack for quantum internet nodes, and bridge the gap
between abstract quantum networking applications and complicated quantum
physical hardware.

Besides being a quantum internet researcher, an embedded systems engineer and an
open-source software enthusiast, Carlo enjoys travelling, visiting museums,
binging movies (the weirder, the better), blasting music in his apartment, and
cooking (not just pizza and lasagna).  He used to do sports before starting his
PhD, and he hopes to resume that soon (but perhaps "after the next deadline").
